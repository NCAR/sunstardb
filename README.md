# sunstardb - the solar-stellar database

sunstardb is a publicly accessible database of observations relevant
to the study of stellar magnetism. These observations form the basis
of the field known as the "solar-stellar connection," which seeks to
understand the mechanisms for the production of magnetic field in
stars and their dependence on fundamental properties such as mass,
luminosity, etc., as well as to understand the place of the Sun's
magnetism in this context. sunstardb aggregates and organizes results
published in the literature into one place in order to accelerate
research efforts in the solar-stellar connection.

sunstardb consists of the following components:

 * postgreSQL database
 * python APIs for interactive access
 * TODO: a web front-end for basic reporting of database contents
